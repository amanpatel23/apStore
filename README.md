# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Github Link:
https://github.com/amanpatel23/apStore

### Hosted Link:
https://apstore.netlify.app/

### apStore Description:
apStore is a full-stack e-commerce web application built using React and Firebase. It provides a seamless shopping experience for users, allowing them to sign up, sign in, and log out. Once logged in, users can browse through a variety of products displayed on the home page. They have the ability to add products to their cart, apply filters to refine their search, and search for specific products by name. The site also offers the functionality to increment and decrement product quantities within the cart. Users can proceed to place orders directly from their cart page. Additionally, a dedicated orders page is available to users, where they can view their previous orders. The site leverages Firebase's Firestore for storing user information and utilizes Firebase Authentication for secure user authentication.

### Functionality and Technologies Used:
1. User authentication (signup, signin, logout)
2. Product browsing and selection
3. Cart management (add, increment, decrement)
4. Filtering and searching products
5. Order placement
6. Previous order history
7. React (front-end framework)
8. Firebase Firestore (database)
9. Firebase Authentication (user authentication)
10. JavaScript (programming language)
11. HTML/CSS (styling and layout)
12. Git/GitHub (version control and repository hosting)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
